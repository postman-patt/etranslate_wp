              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <div class="seperator"></div>
                <p>Founded in 1994, as eTranslate.com.au, eTranslate is an Australian company formed specifically to cater for organisations wanting to go global and multicultural, by using the Internet and its growing reach.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We saw the potential in internationalised / multi-culturalised commerce and the value of going Global and Multi-cultural through the Internet, and how these can be applied to Australian businesses and organisations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>eTranslate have since assisted a number of companies in broadening their market by globalization of their products and services to reach a broader audience both locally and overseas. We have also been successful in helping Australian government agencies to better address the needs of Australian local ethnic communities.</p>
